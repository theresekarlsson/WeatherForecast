# WeatherForecast
ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application showing current weather and 5 day forecast for a specific location (Karlstad, Sweden).

The application uses an API from openweathermap.org, the One Call API to be exact. 
There is no API key included in the project. The setup is that the key is stored in a local secrets.json file (Secret Manager tool).

Information about the Secret Manager tool and user secrets: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=windows
